Version 1.1.1 is now available from the&nbsp;[downloads area](http://web.archive.org/web/20100822015054/http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/use-today/download-cogtool). It fixes several bugs, the most important of which is that CogTool now runs in the Windows 7 release candidate. We are hopeful it will continue to run in the final version of Windows 7, but cannot be certain until Microsoft releases it and we can test CogTool in it.

Users with Windows 7, or who model interfaces using Grafitti, should upgrade as soon as practical. For other users there is no rush, though we recommend doing so at a time you find convenient.
