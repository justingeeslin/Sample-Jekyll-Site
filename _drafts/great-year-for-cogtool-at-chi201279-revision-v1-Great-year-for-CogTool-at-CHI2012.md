At least 5 sessions at CHI 2012 will involve CogTool. Two research papers submitted involving the [IBM CogTool research team](http://web.archive.org/web/20120516131041/http://researcher.ibm.com/view_project.php?id=2238) (one on [CogTool-Explorer](http://web.archive.org/web/20120516131041/http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/publications/cogtool-explorer) and one on [CogTool-Helper](http://web.archive.org/web/20120516131041/http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/publications/cogtool-helper)), a [Case Study from IBM](http://web.archive.org/web/20120516131041/http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/publications/collaborative-cogtool), and the Cognitive Crash Dummy course will be offered. There is rumored to be an additional research paper from outside the &#8220;usual suspects.&#8221; More details will follow when the CHI advanced program comes out.
