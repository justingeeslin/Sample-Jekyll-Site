By studying 100 new users of CogTool, we found that compared to doing Keystroke-Level models by hand, CogTool substantially reduces the number of errors and the variation in quantitative predictions. This means new modelers can be more confident of their predictions than ever before. Read about it in our paper at the BRIMS 2010 conference avaiable at its&nbsp;[research publications page](http://web.archive.org/web/20120114124503/http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/publications/reducing-variability-between-novice-modelers).
