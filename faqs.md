### How much does CogTool cost? {#cost}

CogTool, its documentation, and participation in this community, is currently free for everyone.

### What operating systems run CogTool? {#OS}

Macintosh OS 10.4 or later; or Windows XP, Vista, or Windows 7.

There are no plans to port CogTool to Linux.

### How do I learn to use CogTool? {#getting-started}

The CogTool User Guide can be downloaded for free and is quite complete (but perhaps a bit daunting). Videos of how to use CogTool features are in the works and will appear on this site as they become available — rough drafts are available now in the \[Documentation and Other Support\](/web/20140221021009/http://cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu/use-today/documentation-and-other-support) page.  
We also give tutorials at professional conferences, which are posted in the Events section of this website. If your company or organization would like to arrange a tutorial for your members, please contact us.

### Why should I bother creating an account? {#BotherAccount}

As a visitor to the CogTool site, you can read everything and download the CogTool software and documentation. But you cannot post anything. If you want to ask questions or participate in discussions on the Forums, or if you want to share your work with CogTool here, you need to create an account and sign in.  
Why? Two reasons. First, to continue getting research support for CogTool, we have to be able to show that people are using it and finding it useful. We don&#8217;t want to require everyone to register, so we are hoping that you will be willing to register if you have found CogTool interesting enough to want to post something. We wil NOT use your registration information information except in the aggregate. Second, the registration process uses CAPTCHA to try to keep the bots out.

### My question isn&#8217;t addressed here. How do I get an answer? {#NotHere}
