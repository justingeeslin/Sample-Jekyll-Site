CogTool is moving to GitHub, at <a href="https://github.com/cogtool" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/cogtool </a>

The latest version, and the User Guide, can be downloaded from <a href="https://github.com/cogtool/cogtool/releases/tag/1.2.2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">https://github.com/cogtool/cogtool/releases/tag/1.2.2</a> 

The old CogTool website, at cogtool.hcii.cs.cmu.edu, will go away..
