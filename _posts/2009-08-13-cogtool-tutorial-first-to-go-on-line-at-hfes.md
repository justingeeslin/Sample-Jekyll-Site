  The CogTool tutorial will be delivered both in person and on-line through Web+audio. This is the first time HFES will be putting any tutorials on-line and we are thrilled to be part of the experiment.

WK2 Cognitive Crash Dummies: Predictive Human Performance Modeling for Interactive System Design**&nbsp;  
_Bonnie John, Carnegie Mellon University_&nbsp;  
LEVEL: Beginner.&nbsp;  
ON-SITE FEE: $225 members, $275 nonmembers, $50 students.&nbsp;  
**OFF-SITE FEE: $110 members, $140 nonmembers, $25 students**&nbsp;  
Why is Google like the Carlsbad Police Department? They both reported using predictive human performance models &#8211; aka cognitive crash dummies â€“ to guide system design. Just as crash dummies in the automotive industry save lives by testing the physical safety of automobiles before they are brought to market, cognitive crash dummies save time, money, and potentially even lives by enabling designers of computer-based systems to test their design ideas before implementing them. Cognitive crash dummies are engineering models of human performance that can make quantitative predictions of human behavior using proposed systems without waiting for empirical studies on running prototypes. Scores of research papers and practical experience have demonstrated the accuracy and value of such models in the 25 years since they were introduced in The Psychology of Human Computer Interaction (Card, Moran, & Newell, 1983). Today there are tools that support modeling; it can be taught effectively in a few hours to participants without requiring expertise in computational modeling. This workshop will review the state of the art of predictive modeling in HCI. Participants will use their own laptops to build a storyboard of an interactive system using CogTool and create a model of skilled performance time on that storyboard. Peer review will provide an opportunity for discussing storyboard and modeling options and trade-offs. The workshop will end with a review of other tools currently available and a look to the future of predictive modeling.&nbsp;_Note: This workshop is also available to off-site participants via Web+audio. See the registration fees above. Log-in/dial-in instructions will be sent in September._
